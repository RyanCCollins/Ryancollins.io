I remember on more than one occasion that he would stop by my office, just to report a problem or issue that no one else (even his supervisors or those in much more senior positions) had identified.

Ryan was known by managers to be dependable, knowledgeable, skilled in data systems and IT, friendly and helpful. Ryan takes initiative and engages in his own professional development, whether through taking courses outside of work or self-taught, online learning. He has tremendous leadership potential, both in terms of his interpersonal skills and his solid knowledge of data systems...",
