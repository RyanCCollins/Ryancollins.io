      Engineers I've had the pleasure of knowing. He has demonstrated
      his leadership skills as leader of Hacksmiths and has a personality
      that inspires those around him to always do their best. I have
      gained a lot of knowledge about software development from Ryan,
      who always takes the time to explain concepts that are difficult
      to grasp. Whether as a team member or as a leader, Ryan would be
      an asset to any project. `,

      applies his energy to. He is extremely knowledgeable
      and has also some fundamental traits that make him ideal in
      any team. He is very open minded, determined and well rounded
      in javascript, Front-End and Back-End. He did a tremendous job
      coordinating a team of developers from different parts of the
      globe to achieve results within a deadline on the Food Drivr project.
      I really enjoyed our hacking marathons and working hard together towards
      a goal. Ryan was always either helping out the Front-End or the
      Back-End team and even hopping in with the Mobile one as well.
      His dedication and knowledge as a developer are inspiring!`,
