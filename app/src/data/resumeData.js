          edge skills to create progressive web applications, utilizing technologies
          that you probably have yet to hear of. Sensor based device access, Google's Polymer
          library, Service Worker and others. Taught by industry leaders, this degree focuses
          on teaching best practices to create offline first web applications built for
          the internet of things. As a backend developer, mastering client-side development
          in great detail is fascinating and only serves to expand the array of technologies at my
          disposal. I expect to work in a top level role at a bleeding edge company upon completion
          of this degree. I am starting it in April, 2016 and will expect to receive the credential
          by the end of the year.`

          for creating powerful web applications built on the Ruby on Rails framework.
            Having experience implementing Ruby on Rails applications in my past work has
              been beneficial to my education, however, the Udacity Ruby track will bring me
              well beyond the level of an ordinary Rails developer. The track is broken into
              three components: Ruby Programming, Ruby on Rails and Senior Ruby on Rails. As of
              February 2016, I am working on the Ruby Programming section of the course. Some areas
              of focus include: OOP Ruby Programming, Ruby Meta-programming, MVC (fat model, skinny
              controller), Sinatra, Test Driven Development, Active Record, Gem creation
              and management and low-level under-the-hood Rails development.`
