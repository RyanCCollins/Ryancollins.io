# RyanCollins.io v2.0

Rewrite of my professional portfolio and blog utilizing React, Redux, Keystone, Node, MongoDb, Foundation, etc.

A performance optimized React single page app and NodeJS backend.  Take a look at my [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@ryancollinsio/performance-optimizing-a-react-single-page-app-a68985fa72cc#.ngv8a88mr) about performance optimizing React SPAs.

## Getting Started
The application utilizes Webpack and Webpack dev server.  The package.json is setup with all of the install and other scripts to make setup running and building a breeze.  Once running, view the app at: http://localhost:8080/

Run
```
npm install
```

from the root of the project directory, followed by
```
npm run start
```

Note that the server / API needs to be run to show blog posts.  You can get the server running with:
```
node keystone
```

To see the admin interface, go to /keystone.
